# **Flag Quiz App**

## **Overview**
As a software engineer, I wanted to create an interactive way to learn world flags while improving my Android development skills. The **Flag Quiz App** tests users' knowledge of flags through multiple-choice questions, tracks scores, and includes a "Learn Mode" with fun flag facts.

### **How to Use the App**
1. **Quiz Mode**: Answer multiple-choice questions about flags.
2. **Score Tracking**: See your progress and high scores.
3. **Learn Mode**: Study flags and their meanings before taking the quiz.

### **Purpose**
This app helps users improve their geography knowledge while providing a clean, user-friendly experience. It also helped me practice:
- Android UI design
- Data handling (flags and country info)
- User interaction and feedback
